# What I Learnt

Until now, I had only used Python for data analysis in Jupyter Notebooks or Databricks. This project gave me the opportunity to explore Pythonâ€™s core programming features beyond data analysis. While I was already familiar with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts from Java, it was interesting to apply them in Python and compare the syntax differences.
